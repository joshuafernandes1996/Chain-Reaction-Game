### Guide:
> Chain reaction is a strategy game for two players. The objective of chain reaction is to take control of the board by eliminating opponent's orbs.

>Players take it in turns to place their orbs in a cell.Once a cell has reached critical number of orbs,they explode into the surrounding cells adding an extra orb and claiming the cell for the player. Players may only place their orbs in a blank cell or a cell that contains orbs of their own colour.As soon as a player loses all his orbs is out of the game.
